Network link to a master apcupsd through apcupsd's Network Information Server.
This is used if the UPS powering your computer is connected to a different
computer for monitoring.

@item snmp
SNMP network link to an SNMP-enabled UPS device.

@item netsnmp
Same as the SNMP above but requires use of the net-snmp library.  Unless you
have a specific need for this old driver, you should use the @code{'snmp}
instead.

@item dumb
An old serial character device for use with simple-signaling UPSes.

@item pcnet
A PowerChute Network Shutdown protocol which can be used as an alternative to
an SNMP with the AP9617 family of smart slot cards.

A serial device for use with newest SmartUPS models supporting the MODBUS
protocol.

@var{vendor} can be can be \"APC\" or \"APC_NOTRAP\".  \"APC_NOTRAP\" will

@item pcnet
Set to @code{@var{ipaddr}:@var{username}:@var{passphrase}:@var{port}}.  The
@var{ipaddr} is the IP address of the UPS management card.  The @var{username}

from the UPS, normally 3052.  If this parameter is empty or missing, the
default of 3052 will be used.
