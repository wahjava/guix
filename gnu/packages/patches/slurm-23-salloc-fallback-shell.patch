Have 'salloc' use $SHELL or /bin/sh as the fallback shell.

This is useful in situations where glibc’s Name Service Switch (NSS) is
dysfunctional (with ‘getpwuid’ returning NULL), which can happen when
/etc/nsswitch.conf specifies plugins that fail to be loaded in user code, for
instance because user code is linked against an incompatible libc.
