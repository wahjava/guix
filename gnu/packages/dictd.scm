     "The libmaa library provides many low-level
data structures which are helpful for writing compilers, including hash
tables, sets, lists, debugging support, and memory management.  Although
libmaa was designed and implemented as a foundation for the Khepara
transformation system, the data structures are generally applicable to a
wide range of programming problems.

The memory management routines are especially helpful for improving the
performance of memory-intensive applications.")

dictionaries that can be served by @command{dictd} or Dico.")
