# Provide the CAP_CHOWN capability so that guix-daemon can create and chown
# /var/guix/profiles/per-user/$USER and also chown failed build directories
# when using '--keep-failed'.  Note that guix-daemon explicitly drops ambient
# capabilities before executing build processes so they don't inherit them.
