# This hook script prevents the user from pushing to the project's Git repo if
# any of the new commits' OpenPGP signatures cannot be verified, if a commit is
# signed with an unauthorized key, or if the channel news file is malformed
# (which would break the build).

# Called by "git push" after it has checked the remote status, but before
# anything has been pushed.  If this script exits with a non-zero status nothing
# will be pushed.
#
# This hook is called with the following parameters:
#
# $1 -- Name of the remote to which the push is being done
# $2 -- URL to which the push is being done
#
# If pushing without using a named remote those arguments will be equal.
#
# Information about the commits which are being pushed is supplied as lines to
# the standard input in the form:
#
#   <local ref> <local sha1> <remote ref> <remote sha1>

# This is the "empty hash" used by Git when pushing a branch deletion.
