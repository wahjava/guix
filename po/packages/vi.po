"data.  The location the backup data is stored is assumed not to be a trusted\n"
"environment (e.g.  a shared space where others like system administrators are\n"
"able to access your backups).  Restic is built to secure your data against\n"
"such attackers.\n"
"\n"
"@item Efficient: With the growth of data, additional snapshots should only\n"
